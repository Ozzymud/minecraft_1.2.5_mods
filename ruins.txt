# Global Options for the Ruins mod
#
# tries_per_chunk is the number of times, per chunk, that the generator will
#     attempt to create a ruin.
#
# chance_to_spawn is the chance, out of 100, that a ruin will be generated per
#     try in this chunk.  This may still fail if the ruin does not have a
#     suitable place to generate.
#
# chance_for_site is the chance, out of 100, that another ruin will attempt to
#     spawn nearby if a ruin was already successfully spawned.  This bypasses
#     the normal tries per chunk, so if this chance is set high you may end up
#     with a lot of ruins even with a low tries per chunk and chance to spawn.
#
# specific_<biome name> is the chance, out of 100, that a ruin spawning in the
#     specified biome will be chosen from the biome specific folder.  If not,
#     it will choose a generic ruin from the root ruin folder.
